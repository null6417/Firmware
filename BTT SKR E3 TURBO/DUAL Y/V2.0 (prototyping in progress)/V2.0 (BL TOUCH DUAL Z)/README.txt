V2.0 DUAL Y FIRMWARE 

NOTES:

this firmware is made to enable the BTT SKR E3 TURBO to work with my dual y stepper motor mount v2.0

this firmware is NOT compatable with V1.0 dual y mount


CHANGES:

changed INVERT_Y_DIR falst to INVERT_Y_DIR true

changed Y_BED_SIZE 183 to Y_BED_SIZE 220

changed DEFAULT_TRAVEL_ACCELERATION 2000 to DEFAULT_TRAVEL_ACCELERATION 500

--- YOU WILL NEED TO MANUALLY REVERSE STEPPER MOTOR DIRECTION ON 1 MOTOR BY SWAPPING WIRES ---
you can find a guide on how to do that here: https://youtu.be/AgyNM7FQrmk?t=106
